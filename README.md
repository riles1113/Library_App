Greetings

This is meant as an API based library application, where the central program upon which it runs is the twitter app X, on a mobile device though it can function on PC and has cross platform capability, programmed in javascript of course.

Right now the API isn't filled in as it is part of the X app and multiple libraries could be integrated, but they would all need functioning APIs. As a solid basis for a program of this nature it could be included with individual libraries that are willing to add program function to work with their servers and the application has a built in database including waiting lists so the user can be alerted when they are in the queue exit for signing out e books online.

If you like the program feel free to make a copy or branch.
Good day.
